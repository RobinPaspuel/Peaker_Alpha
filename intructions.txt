## It is neccesary to create an .env file including all the data required, the 
## example structure is showed in env-example.txt.
## In production these env variables will be
## setted in the server.

## The file peakerDB-10-23-2021.sql contains the neccesary code to generate the 
## database (PostgreSQL) with the required tables.
## To generate the database you can do it by command line with:
    psql -U postgres
    # CREATE DATABASE "peaker"
    \q
    psql -U postgres peaker < peakerDB-10-23-2021.sql

## Alternatively you can create the database manually, open the query editor
## and copy all the contents of peakerDB-10-23-2021.sql and execute.

## To generate a valid JWT Key for JWTSECRETKEY it is neccesary to run the following
## command on the shell:
    openssl rand -hex 32

## And copy the output into the JWTSECRETKEY env variable

## The documentation for all the endpoints in Peaker is available at:
    localhost:8080/api-docs

## In this interface you can test all the endpoints with instructions included

## Alternatively you can use Postman to test the endpoints. (A recomendation is to install
## the pluggin "Thunder Client" in vscode which is an extension that replicated the working
## of Postman).
